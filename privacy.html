    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="meta">Effective date: October 23, 2025<br>Developer: Banana Sky Studio</div>

    <p>Banana Sky Studio ("we", "us", or "our") builds and publishes the App. We respect your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how we handle data. This Privacy Policy explains our practices.</p>

    <h2>1. Data We (Banana Sky Studio) Collect</h2>
    <p>We, Banana Sky Studio, do <strong>not</strong> directly collect, store, or transmit any personal information from you. We do not require you to create an account, and we do not have access to any personal identifiers, contact information, or location data.</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Data Collection (Google AdMob)</h2>
    <p>The App displays advertisements from Google AdMob to help fund its development. Google is a third-party service and may collect and use data to provide these ads.</p>
    <p>The types of information Google may collect include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device identifiers (such as the Advertising Identifier or IDFA)</li>
      <li>IP address</li>
      <li>Device and network information</li>
      <li>App usage data (such as ad interactions)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Your Consent & App Tracking Transparency (ATT)</h2>
    <p>Your privacy and control are paramount. As an iOS app, we are required by Apple to ask for your permission to track your activity across other companies' apps and websites. This is done through Apple's **App Tracking Transparency (ATT)** framework.</p>
    <p>You will be shown a pop-up prompt from iOS with the following options:</p>

    <div class="note">
      <p><strong>If You Select "Allow":</strong><br>
      You give us permission to share your device's Advertising Identifier (IDFA) with Google AdMob. Google will use this identifier to show you <strong>personalized ads</strong> that are more relevant to your interests.</p>
      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>If You Select "Ask App Not to Track":</strong><br>
      Your device's Advertising Identifier (IDFA) will not be shared with Google. You will still see the same number of ads, but they will be <strong>non-personalized</strong> (also known as 'contextual' ads). These ads are based on the content of the app you are using, not on your personal data.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>4. Your Choices and Opt-Out</h2>
    <p>You can change your tracking preference for this app at any time in your iOS device's Settings:</p>
    <p>Go to <strong>Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking</strong> and toggle the setting for the App.</p>
    <p>To manage or opt out of personalized advertising from Google across all services, you can also visit the Google Ads Settings page:</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.google.com/settings/ads</a></p>

    <h2>5. Legal Basis for Processing (EU/UK Users)</h2>
    <p>For users in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK), we rely on different legal bases for processing data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personalized Advertising:</strong> Our legal basis for processing your personal data (like the IDFA) for personalized ads is your explicit <strong>Consent</strong>, which you provide via the ATT prompt.</li>
      <li><strong>Non-Personalized Advertising:</strong> Our legal basis for showing non-personalized (contextual) ads is our <strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> in funding our app's continued development and maintenance.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>6. Children</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information (such as through a support request), please contact us so we can take steps to remove that information.</p>
    
    <h2>7. International Users</h2>
    <p>We do not directly store or transfer your data. However, our third-party provider, Google, operates globally. Any data they collect may be stored and processed in any country where Google or its partners maintain facilities. By using the App, you understand that your information may be transferred outside of your resident country.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the "Effective Date" at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:magicscribble@icloud.com">magicscribble@icloud.com</a>.</p>
